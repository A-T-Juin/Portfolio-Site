# Portfolio Site

A simple portfolio page template that is easily changed to fit one's needs by adjusting the resumeData.json file.

## Motivation

This project was started when I was thinking of a way to showcase some works that I have created. I then thought it would be nice if anyone or everyone could have a simple portfolio page that could be tailored to their needs.

## Built With
